Project Outline
===============
	Can this be a gui program?
		Repurpose ACI work
		
	dealer class?
		Dealer.deal
		Dealer.hit
		Dealer.stand

	player class

	Ace handling
		Can be either 1 or 11
		start as 11?
		if hand > 21, 11 -> 1
		if == 21, blackjack

	Start program by creating a dealer object

	Add unit tests if possible
	1 deck of cards
		A = 1 or 11
		Face = 10
		How will this be represented??
			Multidimensional array
			0-3: Suit
			0-12: card
			Once a card has been choosen, add to 'choosen_array'
			Similar to OPORD arrays
	2 players, dealer & player
	each dealt 2 cards
	if either is dealt 21 on opening hand, instant win
	player goes first
		can hit any number of times till bust or stand
		if bust, dealer wins
	dealer must hit if cards < 17
		random int 0-1, if 0 stand, else hit
