<h4>How to Play</h4>
[Maximize terminal for best results]

Once started the game will immediately start a round. Once each player has been dealt 
their hand, you will have the options of '1' to hit or '2' to stand. Selecting hit will deal
you a new card while selecting stand will pass your turn and begin the dealers turn. The round will
progress until either player player busts, both players pass, or a player scores blackjack.
A running tally is kept at the top of the game that shows how any times each player has won.

To quit type 'n' when prompted once a round is over.

Have fun!
